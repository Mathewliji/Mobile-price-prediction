# Mobile-price-prediction
A web application that predicts the price of mobiles is developed. 
Data  was extracted from kaggle. 
EDA was performed. Data preprocessing was performed. 
The problem wasa regression problem. So, it was converted into classification problem. 
Machine learning algorithms- Random Forest Classifier was used to build the model.
The model was saved as a pickle file. 
Flask framework was used to develop the web application that predicts the mobile price prediction.
The model was made available to be used by public with the help of Aws EC2 instances. 
Finally the web application is ready to predict the mobile price.
